If you're reading this, you're probably looking for the "famous" hidden files of the mini-game. 
Or maybe you just like to snoop around the game's files.

Anyway, if you're having too much trouble with the mini-game, here are the three 
directories where the files will be located :

- Documents Folder
- Desktop
- Musics Folder

Now it's your turn. 
You should be able to do it easily.
