        <h1 id="d">Where was A4 paper founded</h1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <div id="e">A4 paper is something we’re all familiar with in Australia – we use it in our printers, our photocopiers -but what you may be surprised to learn is that A4 is actually part of an official metric standard.

            In fact, this was set in 1975 when it was based on a German standard that goes all the way back to 1922.
            <br>
            <br>
            Paper size standards govern the size of sheets of paper used as writing paper, stationery, cards, and for some printed documents.

            The ISO 216 standard, which includes the commonly used A4 size, is the international standard for paper size. It is used across the world except in North America and parts of Central and South America, where North American paper sizes such as "Letter" and "Legal" are used. The international standard for envelopes is the C series of ISO 269.
            <br>
            <br>
            The international paper size standard is ISO 216. It is based on the German DIN 476 standard for paper sizes. ISO paper sizes are all based on a single aspect ratio of the square root of 2, or approximately 1:1.41421. There are different series, as well as several extensions.
            <br>
            <br>
            The following international paper sizes are included in Cascading Style Sheets (CSS): 
            <li>A3</li>
            <li>A4</li>
            <li>A5</li>
            <li>B4</li>
            <li>B5</li>
        </div>
        
        <h1 id="f">What features does the A series paper have</h1>
        <div id="g"><li>A4 is half the size of A3</li>
            <li>A3 is half the size of A2</li>
            <li>A2 is half the size of A1</li>
            <li>A1 is half the size of A0 (the largest in the range)</li>
            <li>A0 is exactly 1m2 of paper(measuring in at 84.1cm x 118.9cm).</li> 
            <br>
             Metric paper weights are measured in grams per square metre (gsm) and this halving or doubling relationship between each size means that mass calculations of large volumes of paper in the print industry is easy.
            <br>
            <br>
            There are 11 sizes in the A series, designated A0–A10, all of which have an aspect ratio of <img src="1.svg" alt="Equation 1" id="p1">, where a is the long side and b is the short side.
            <br>
            <br>
            Since A series sizes share the same aspect ratio (√2), they can be scaled to other A series sizes without being distorted, and two sheets can be reduced to fit on exactly one sheet without any cutoff or margins.
            <br>
            <br>
            The A0 base size is defined as having an area of 1 m2; given an aspect ratio of √2, the dimensions of A0 are:
            <br>
            <img src="2.svg" alt="Equation 2" id=p2>
            <br>
            or, rounded to the nearest millimetre, 841 mm × 1,189 mm (33.1 in × 46.8 in).

            A series sizes are related in that the smaller dimension of a given size is the larger dimension of the next smaller size, and folding an A series sheet in half in its larger dimension—that is, folding it in half parallel to its short edge—results in two halves that are each the size of the next smaller A series size. As such, a folded brochure of a given A series size can be made by folding sheets of the next larger size in half, e.g. A4 sheets can be folded to make an A5 brochure. The fact that halving a sheet with an aspect ratio of √2 results in two sheets that themselves both have an aspect ratio of √2 is proven as follows:
            <img src="3.svg" alt="Equation 3" id="p3">
            <br>
            Where a is the long side and b is the short side. The aspect ratio for the new dimensions of the folded paper is:
            <img src="4.svg" alt="Equation 4" id="p4">
            </div>
            
        <h1 id="h">Quality of life the A series paper provided</h1>
        <div id="i">
            When it comes to the A-series, smaller paper sizes are exactly half the previous paper case every time. This means they are exactly the same shape from one size to the next, with a width-to-height ratio of 1:1:41 at every size. This is a huge help when it comes to resizing images.

            To simplify further – an A4 page can be:
            
            <li>Scaled up by 41% and all artwork and text are the perfect width and height to fill an A3 page</li>
            <li>Scaled down to 71% of its original size to fit perfectly on an A5 page.</li>
            <br>
            This magic number for paper aspect ratio – 1 to the square root of 2 was first suggested all the way back in 1786.
            <br>
            <br>
            The advantages of basing a paper size upon an aspect ratio of √2 were first noted in 1786 by the German scientist and philosopher Georg Christoph Lichtenberg. When a sheet is folded, the length to width ratio does not change.
            <br>
            The formats that became A2, A3, B3, B4 and B5 were developed in France, having been proposed by the mathematician Lazare Carnot, and published for judicial purposes in 1798 during the French Revolution. Early in the 20th century, Dr Walter Porstmann turned Lichtenberg's idea into a proper system of different paper sizes. Porstmann's system was introduced as a DIN standard (DIN 476) in Germany in 1922, replacing a vast variety of other paper formats. Even today, the paper sizes are called "DIN A4" in everyday use in Germany and Austria.
